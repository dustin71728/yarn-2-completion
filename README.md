## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

It is a BASH completion for yarn 2+, supporting macOS default shipped BASH version 3.2 and above.

Tested on BASH 3.2, 4.4, and 5.0 with yarn 2.1.0 and 2.4.2

## Features <a name = "features"></a>

1. Show all the matched workspace's package names for "yarn workspace(s)" commands.

2. Prevent alternative flags from being shown again if one of them is already on the command line

   For example, -v is short for --version, having one on the command line disable the other one because
   they are the same.

3. List all the script names in the package.json for `yarn`, `yarn run`, `yarn workspace ...` or `yarn workspace ... run`; the package.json for which the yarn-2-completion searches depends on the command or the path where the command is typing.

4. Enable one-tab completion during installation (Optional).

5. List all the matched system executables for `yarn exec` or `yarn workspace ... exec` (Optional).

6. Show available words based on the current repository's yarn version; different repositories with different yarn versions won't interfere with each other.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

```
git clone git@github.com:dustin71728/yarn-2-completion.git

./yarn-2-completion/install.sh
```

### Prerequisites

1. Yarn version 2+
2. Node.js 8+
3. Bash 3.2+

### How it works

The installation will modify your BASH environment's startup file .bashrc(Linux) or .bash_profile(macOS) in the home directory.

BASH loads the script for yarn command's completion after opening new terminal.

Your original startup file will be saved, so if something went wrong, just recovering it from the backup file.

It also registers the setup function to PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable; whenever the command prompt gets printed, the script finds out if you are in the repository managed by yarn 2+, then prepares the configurations for accommodating your workflow with yarn commands.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The repository uses [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to do testing, and [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to maintain coding quality.

All the tests are running in the Docker container.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

yarn install

yarn test

# run the specified test cases
yarn test -- -f 'y2c_setup'
```
